Full How-To Guide: Using Village_Connect

Let's walk through the app step-by-step.

How to Create Your Account

The first time you open the app, it will ask you to "Sign Up" or "Log In."

    Tap the "Sign Up" button.

    The app will ask for your basic information, such as:

        Your Name

        Your Email Address

        A new Password

    Fill in these fields.

        Tool Tip: Your password is like a secret key. Choose something you can remember but that others wouldn't guess. It's a good idea to write it down in a safe place.

    Once you're done, tap the "Create Account" or "Register" button.

    That's it! You'll now be logged in. In the future, you'll just use the "Log In" button with your email and the password you just created.

How to See Events & Activities

When you open the app, you will most likely land on the main Home screen or Events screen.

    This screen will show you a list of all upcoming events, probably starting with what's happening today.

    You can scroll with your finger (swipe up and down) to see the full list.

    If you see an event you want to know more about, just tap on it.

    A new screen will open showing you all the details:

        What the event is

        When it starts and ends

        Where it is (the location or recreation center)

        A description of the event

How to Search for Specific Events

If you're looking for something specific, the Search feature is your best friend.

    Look for a magnifying glass icon (🔍) or a bar that says "Search". It's usually at the top of the screen.

    Tap on the search bar. Your on-screen keyboard will pop up.

    Type what you're looking for.

        Example: Golf

        Example: Mahjong

        Example: Saturday

    The app will automatically filter the list to show you only the events that match your search.

How to Save a "Favorite" Event

When you find an event you don't want to forget, save it as a "Favorite."

    When you are looking at the details for an event, look for a Heart icon (❤️) or a Star icon (⭐).

    Tap the icon! It will usually fill in with color, showing you've saved it.

    That's it! The event is now saved.

    To find your list of saved events, look for a "Favorites" or "My Events" section in the app menu.

How to Get Notifications (Alerts)

A notification is a small pop-up message from the app that appears on your phone's screen.

    For Reminders: When you save an event as a "Favorite" (see above), the app may ask if you want a reminder. You can set it to alert you 1 hour before the event, for example.

    For Community News: The app might also send alerts for important, all-community news, like a road closure or a special holiday schedule.

    Tool Tip: The first time you use the app, your phone will ask, "Allow 'Village_Connect' to send you notifications?" It is highly recommended that you tap "Allow" to get these helpful reminders. You can always change this later in your phone's Settings.
